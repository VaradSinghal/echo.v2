# Echo Agent - User Guide

This guide explains how to effectively use the Echo Agent Command Center to manage your codebase evolution through community feedback.

## 1. Monitoring Repositories

Navigate to the **Monitoring Panel** in the dashboard. Here you can see which repositories are currently being tracked. Toggle the switch to `Active` to start processing new comments.

## 2. Analyzing Feedback

The agent automatically processes comments in the background. You can manually trigger a full sweep by clicking **"Run Analysis Now"** in the Command Center.
- **Sentiment**: Track the overall mood of your community.
- **Topics**: See recurring themes extracted by the AI.

## 3. Semantic Search

Use the **Semantic Search** bar to find feedback by intent. Instead of searching for keywords like "bug", try natural language queries like:
- *"What are people complaining about regarding the login flow?"*
- *"Show me suggestions for new profile features."*

## 4. Reviewing Code Proposals

When the agent identifies a clear fix or feature request with high confidence, it will appear in the **PR Queue**.
- **Review**: Click a proposal to see the AI's explanation and reasoning.
- **Approve**: Clicking "Approve & Generate PR" will automatically create a new branch, commit the changes, and open a Pull Request on GitHub.
- **Dismiss**: If a proposal is incorrect or premature, dismiss it to keep your queue clean.

## 5. Local Intelligence & Security

Echo Agent now runs **100% Local Intelligence** via the Python backend. This ensures that your community feedback and codebase data never leave your infrastructure. 
- **Privacy**: No cloud LLM providers are used for analysis or code generation.
- **Performance**: High-speed processing using Qwen 2.5 optimized for code.
- **Costs**: Zero API costs for embeddings or generation.
